# ðŸš€ How to Start Your Hackathon Website

## PowerShell Execution Policy Issue

Your system has PowerShell script execution disabled. Here are the solutions:

### Option 1: Run in Command Prompt (Recommended)
1. Open **Command Prompt** (cmd.exe) instead of PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\bhanu\Desktop\myhack
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Option 2: Enable PowerShell Scripts (One-time setup)
1. Open PowerShell as **Administrator**
2. Run this command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Type 'Y' to confirm
4. Then navigate to your project and run:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\bhanu\Desktop\myhack
   npm start
   ```

### Option 3: Use VS Code Terminal
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Open the terminal (Ctrl + `)
3. The terminal should work without issues
4. Run: `npm start`

## After Starting

Once the server starts, your website will automatically open in your default browser at:
```

```

If it doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to that URL.
